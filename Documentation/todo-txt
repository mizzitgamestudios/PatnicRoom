Hi, RedRastaRigger here.
This is supposed to be a little guide to set you up for possible modding and deeper understanding of the inner workings of our Game.
Its audience is people who want to edit the GD-Scripts and have a solid foundation in Software development.
If you are looking for an more easy way to mod,try out our other section called "GUIded modding".
We would like to here your feedback, were some parts here not understanable or even plain wrong ? lets fix it to help following modders.

as always: restore your Peace.
