	"do we need quotations?": false,

	"---- WHY TO USE JSON ----": "",
	"there are a number of reasons to structure in json": "",

	"end user friendly": "people without experience in coding can help to design content",
	"Compatible": "Json is Plain-Text and can be automated to update itself in the game",
	"Folderstructure": "Jsons can be organiced in Folders which makes it easier to keep clear",


	"---- HOW TO WRITE JSON ----": "",
	"bevore we go to more complex things,one reminder": "as you may have seen",
	"we have to write a comma after a entry": "thats because we have followup-entries",
	"the last entry has no comma": "thats very important",
	"if you are unsure of the correctness,there is a very good validator online:":
  "https://jsonformatter.org/json-parser",
	"it can even give you a better Overview,": "click on the left corner-text of the right block",


	"---- HOW TO GET GOOD IN JSON ----": "",
	"the first advanced data is a floating-point number": 4.2,
	"look close,we use a dot and no comma": -14.2,

	"By a comma,we signal a following Entry": "we can use this for lists",
	"for this we have to put clamps around the values": ["just", "like", "this"],
	"we can do this with numbers as well": [0, -4, 7, 1],
	"but mixing text and numbers cause crashes": ["there", "4", "some1", "has to quote them"],

	"the last one is maybe a little bit harder to wrap your head around...": "Objects",
	"by writing a bracket": {
		"Syntax": "we put things in a kind of folder/subdirectory",
		"Acces": "to get to those value,you first have to enter the key of the brackets",
		"Use": "this can be usefull to group things which are similar together",
		"note": "like in a list,the last entry has no followup and therefore no comma"
