This extension uses other language extensions to determine the line of code.Therefore, you may need to install the language extension to support a new language.

Conversely, as the number of language extensions increases, the range of support for this feature also increases.

## VSCode Counter 2.0 is released!

* Experimental support for "**VSCode Remote Development**".

    When using VSCode Counter in *VSCode Remote Development*, use the `Save language configurations` function You will need to. 
    [See below for more information](#save-language-configurations).

## Features

- Count the code lines of source code in workspace or directory.
- Count the code lines of the current file in real time.


## Usage

### Count in workspace

* Open the command palette and select  `VSCodeCounter: Count lines in workspace`.

    * Available languages can be increased by adding language extensions.

### Save language configurations

**VSCode Counter** is able to aggregate in unknown languages by referring to the information in the installed language extensions. However, I found out that **this information is not available in Remote Development**.

Therefore, VSCode Counter's ability of **collecting VSCode language extensions** is now called as an independent function. The idea is to collect the information once in the local environment and store it so that it can be used remotely.

* First, launch VSCode on your local.
* Then, open the command palette and select  `VSCodeCounter: Save the collected language configurations`.
* Then *settings.json* will store the configuration information collected from the current language extensions .

* Connect to the remote and use the VSCodecounter as usual.


You can also change the location where your configurations are stored.
However, you must carry the stored information to the remote environment by yourself.
